# 👋 Hi, I'm Benjamin Matapo

**Full-Stack Developer · Software Engineering Student · Builder**

I'm a developer based in Newcastle, UK, passionate about turning ideas into real, working products. I’m currently studying Computer Science at Newcastle University, but most of my learning happens outside the classroom, building apps, freelancing, and solving problems with code.  
I believe the best software isn't just functional, it’s human, intuitive, and makes life a little easier.
